# CS1002 Assignment 2 Project 

The aim of this assignment was to produce a program that can be used by the user to check the validity of very simplified Sudoku puzzles. 

The program should be able to take a puzzle as an input, and check whether this puzzle is valid or not, in terms of both the format of the puzzle (number of rows and columns), the values within the puzzle and whether there are any duplicate values. 

There are two possible block types for these puzzles, being numerical puzzles (3 by 3 grid, for numbers 1 to 9) and textual puzzles (5 by 5 grid, for alphabetic characters from A to Y), and have the validation of all aspects work for both cases.

## Result

This Assignment was graded as a 17 of 20, a First-Class Grade, passing most unit tests provided.
